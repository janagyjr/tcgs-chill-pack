# TCG's Chill Pack  
## The Experience  
TCG's Chill Pack is all about exploration and massively epic builds in a survival world designed to challenge you but not make it impossible to explore. Find your niche within the technological bounds or explore a limited range of magical options as you make your way through 5 unique main dimensions (Overworld, End, Nether, Aether, Erebus), a mining dimension, or one of the many dimensions added by Galacticraft and ExtraPlanets. Thanks to RF Tools and Buildcraft, gathering those resources becomes easy once you are sufficiently into Tinker's Construct. Of course with tool leveling from Iguanas Tinker's Tweaks you'll never want to part with your trusty pick or deadly shuriken of doom!

And to connect all of your awesome builds together you have Railcraft to build massive rail lines between your towns, and even within build areas. The industrious redstoner may even be able to automate pickups and delivery's from one area to another on a set schedule. Given the limitations of FTB Utility's chunkloading, there is Chicken Chunks to the rescue (just keep in mind others if you're on an MP server)!

If you enjoy technology and exploration, this is definitely a pack you can chill out with and play long-term.  

## Support Options  
You can find my pack on the [Twitch launcher desktop app](http://www.curseforge.com/) or on [Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/tcgs-chill-pack)  

Always get TCG's Chill Pack from official sources and you'll never have anything to worry about! Launching the pack from launchers other than Twitch is not supported currently due to certain mod incompatibilities.  Am aware of at least one issue and am working to have it fixed if feasible.
