Notes: This is going to be the final regular release of this version of Chill Pack. I have moved on to working on Chill Pack 2 (1.10.2) and Chill Pack 3 (1.12.2). The only updates from here on out will be bug fix updates for any mods still updating. I appreciate all of the support from my friends (Tadakino, Broot, theleftmouseknop, MjolnirsRevenge, animorphed, BlockheadTrouble and many others) and the community. I hope everyone continues to enjoy this version of Chill Pack, 1.7.10 was definitely the Golden Age of modded and was one of the reasons I started here. Now onward toward the present!  The server.dat is also removed because I am no longer hosting a server. There will also be no new server packs. Too many instabilities to make it worth multiplayer.
